# freecodecamp_exercises- 5/5 complete
After completing my Data Analysis progrom at CareerFoundry, I decided to go through and complete the excercises available at the end of the Data Analysis curriculum at freecodecamp.org. This repository holds the code for my answers to these questions. 


# DESCRIPTION OF FILES WITHIN REPOSITORY:

### 'MEANS-VARIANCE-STD CALCULATOR':
The challenge here was to create a calculator in Python that could return some basic statistics when given a list of numbers. This file is my python code for the challenge, which passed all tests on the Replit they provided for the task.

### 'DEMOGRAPHIC DATA ANALYZER':
In this excercise we simply used pandas to retreive demographic information and some descriptive stats from a data set. Instead of fussing with their Replit popup-code-window thing, I answered the questions in the prompt using Jupyter, and checked my answers against the tester in the Replit.

### 'MEDICAL DATA VIZ':
Using the medical data provided I made flags for groups related to health risks based on various factors. Same as I did with the Demographic Data Analyzer, I completed this using Jupyter instead of using their Replit. I also checked my answers against their examples.

### 'TIME-SERIES-VIZ':
A time series visualization project where we used data about a website's monthly page views to create time-series graphs. Got to learn some new grouping techniques along the way. Again, completed using Jupyter only. Also used Seaborn instead of Matplotlib on one excercise because I like it more. 

### 'WATER-LEVEL-PREDICT':
For this project, freecodecamp provided sea level measurement data and we used scipy to create regressions and chart trend lines to predict how much sea levels will have risen by 2050. Completed in Jupyter Notebooks.
