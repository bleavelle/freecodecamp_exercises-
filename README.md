# freecodecamp_exercises- 2/5 complete
After completing my Data Analysis progrom at CareerFoundry, I decided to go through and complete the excercises available at the end of the Data Analysis curriculum at freecodecamp.org. This repository holds the code for my answers to these questions. 


# DESCRIPTION OF FILES WITHIN REPOSITORY:

### 'MEANS-VARIANCE-STD CALCULATOR':
My python code for the first challenge, which passed all tests on the Replit they provided for the task.


### 'DEMOGRAPHIC DATA ANALYZER':
These are my answers to the questions for the demographic data analyzer exercise on freecodecamp.com. Instead of fussing with their Replit popup-code-window thing, I answered the questions in the prompt using Jupyter.
